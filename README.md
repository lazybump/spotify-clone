# Spotify clone with React

Small clone site that lets you search for songs and create your own playlist which you can then save to your Spotify account.

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, React, Spotify API

**Process:** After organising the file structure and components, I implemented code to retrieve an access token from the user and use that to make some HTTP requests with Spotify's API.
